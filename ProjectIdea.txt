I'd like to make a sort of resume site for myself.

Users would be able to filter projects by certain tags,
like by programming language, hardware, or general subject.

Signed in users will be able to favorite/like projects and
leave comments. They can also change their display name and
profile pictures.

I'll probably use the CSS Framework Bootstrap, since we used 
Bulma in a previous course, Web Programming, though I went without
for this assignment (login & signup pages).
